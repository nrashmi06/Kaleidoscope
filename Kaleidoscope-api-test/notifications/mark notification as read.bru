  # Mark Notification as Read

  Marks a specific notification as read and updates the unread count.

  ## Path Parameters
  - `notificationId`: ID of the notification to mark as read

  ## Behavior
  - Sets `isRead` to `true` for the notification
  - Decrements unread count in Redis
  - Broadcasts updated count via SSE to connected clients
  - If notification is already read, no changes are made

  ## Authorization
  - Only the notification owner can mark it as read
  - Returns 403 Forbidden if user doesn't own the notification

  ## Response
  Returns the updated notification:
  ```json

    "success": true,
