  # Delete Notification

  Permanently deletes a notification from the system.

  ## Path Parameters
  - `notificationId`: ID of the notification to delete

  ## Behavior
  - Permanently removes the notification from the database
  - If notification was unread, decrements the unread count
  - Broadcasts updated count via SSE to connected clients
  - Prevents count from going negative (ensures minimum of 0)

  ## Authorization
  - Only the notification owner can delete it
  - Returns 403 Forbidden if user doesn't own the notification
  - Returns 404 Not Found if notification doesn't exist

  ## Response
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Notification deleted successfully",
    "data": null
  }
  ```

  ## Use Case
  - User dismissing/removing individual notifications
  - Cleaning up notification history
