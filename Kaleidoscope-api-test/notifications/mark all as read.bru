  # Mark All Notifications as Read

  Marks all notifications for the authenticated user as read and resets the unread count to zero.

  ## Behavior
  - Updates all unread notifications to read status in a single transaction
  - Resets unread count to 0 in Redis
  - Broadcasts count update (0) via SSE to connected clients

  ## Response
  Returns the number of notifications that were marked as read:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "All notifications marked as read",
    "data": {
      "markedReadCount": 12
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Use Case
  - "Mark all as read" button in notification center
  - Clearing notification badge when user views all notifications
}
