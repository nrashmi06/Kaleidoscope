  # Stream Notification Count (SSE)

  Establishes a Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection to receive real-time unread notification count updates.

  ## Initial Broadcast
  - Upon connection, the server immediately sends the current unread count
  - Event name: `unseen-count`
  - Data: integer value representing unread count

  ## Live Updates
  - Whenever a new notification arrives, the count is automatically broadcasted
  - When notifications are marked as read, the updated count is sent
  - When notifications are deleted, the count is decremented and sent

  ## Connection Management
  - Connection timeout: 1 hour
  - Automatic cleanup of stale connections every 5 minutes
  - Connection is removed when user logs out

  ## Response Format
  ```
  event: unseen-count
  data: 5
  ```
